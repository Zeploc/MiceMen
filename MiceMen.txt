- MM_UI
- BP_MM_UI


Todo:
- Find move line up in visual studio key
- Random first player turn
- Not move the same column that was just moved
- Not move a column more than 6 times in a row
- Can move columns above if all mice on one column
- If one mouse per team, only 8 turns (total) until game force ends, further along is winner (if equal position then tie)

- If current team goes first, lands on next team mouse, then that team mouse goes, it is then floating
- Ratio blocks so there are enough empty ones?

Bugs Found
- Block (visually) stayed on previous place instead of wrapping around
- (related to above) After switching a turn, the GridObject GridSize became invalid (X=-74756880 Y=32764) (fixed?)
- When no mice are processed, the visual is negated by the other teams
- Sometimes there is a free slot, and the mouse does not move (not impacting mouse around them)
- Editor crash when switching grid size (occasionally)

- Class declarations at the top
- Break into functions for different levels of code/logic
- Functions for cleanliness preferred
- Use regions #pragma region AND #pragma endregion
- const reference function parameters
- const functions when don't need to modify functions
- Function/Variable Headers
	@param
- Commenting
- Event log for debugging - Log Macro, Add location (place in code called) in macro + object
- Check UPROPERTY and UFUNCTIONS are relevant
- Move functions else where (librarys/components) where appropriate



- Visual/Gameplay
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To put in readme:
- Controls
- Logging system
- Debug methods
- Controller/local player setup
- Further decisions for if networked


Gamemode
- Handles turns
- Setup grid Manager

Grid Manager
- Creates grid Elements
- Grid Rebuild
- Grid interaction with gameplay elements

Grid object
- Grid - Array<GridInfo> Collumns by rows (x by y)
- Handles & Updates Grid
- Store free slots as map, updated on change (reduce iteration)
- Grid Cleanup


Gameplay Elements
- Cheese/Block Actor
- Mouse Actor - Not a pawn/character

Pawn
- Gameplay Interaction
- View

Player Controller
- UI control
- Local player per side
- Begin Turn function

UI
- Base in code, bind widgets

Visual/Gameplay
- Highlight collumns on players turn
- Yellow for moveable, red for collumn which can't be moved
- Green when held/once in valid slot?
- Arrows on top and bottom show when hover
- Arrows change when snapping to new position (hide/ only show other direction)
- Platform that the mouse falls through when getting a point (overlay with physics based visual)
- When dragging visualise element that wraps around
- Bounce visual jumping on another mouses head
- Move faster but leave trail

UI/Game loop
- Difficulty - easy/hard
- AI vs local player
- Grid Size (default, custom sliders)
- Sandbox mode, single player move grid around

To Plan:
- Environment/Background
- AI?

Stretch:
- Mouse Characters
- Jump/walk animations
- Timeline visuals for blocks moving
- Idle/fidget animations

Fun Ides to expand on:
- Mice/player can have abilities/power ups (like worms) such as
	- borrow through a cheese block
	- Jump up a cheese block
	- Teleport through
	- Swap places with another mice? Might be counter intuitive
	- Move a collumn more than 1 slot
	- Move more than one collumn
	- Skip a players turn
- Larger/smaller maps
