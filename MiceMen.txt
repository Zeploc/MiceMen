Structure/Layout
 Class declarations at the top?
 Setup event log for debugging

Todo:
- Store colour and retrieve (not multi define)
- Ratio blocks so there are enough empty ones?
- Win condition
- Not move the same column that was just moved
- Not move a column more than 6 times in a row
- If current team goes first, lands on next team mouse, then that team mouse goes, it is then floating

To put in readme:
- Controls
- Logging system
- Debug methods
- Controller/local player setup
- Further decisions for if networked

Bugs Found
- Block (visually) stayed on previous place instead of wrapping around
- (related to above) After switching a turn, the GridObject GridSize becamee invalid (X=-74756880 Y=32764) (fixed?)
- Not all columns hightlighted for player...? (can interact)
- Sometimes there is a free slot, and the mouse does not move (not impacting mouse around them)

Gamemode
- Handles turns
- Setup grid Manager

Grid Manager
- Creates grid Elements
- Grid Rebuild
- Grid interaction with gameplay elements

Grid object
- Grid - Array<GridInfo> Collumns by rows (x by y)
- Handles & Updates Grid
- Store free slots as map, updated on change (reduce iteration)
- Grid Cleanup


Gameplay Elements
- Cheese/Block Actor
- Mouse Actor - Not a pawn/character

Pawn
- Gameplay Interaction
- View

Player Controller
- UI control
- Local player per side
- Begin Turn function

UI
- Base in code, bind widgets

Visual/Gameplay
- Highlight collumns on players turn
- Yellow for moveable, red for collumn which can't be moved
- Green when held
- Arrows on top and bottom show when hover
- Arrows change when snapping to new position (hide/ only show other direction)
- Platform that the mouse falls through when getting a point (overlay with physics based visual)
- When dragging visualise element that wraps around

UI/Game loop
- Difficulty - easy/hard
- AI vs local player
- Grid Size (default, custom sliders)
- Sandbox mode, single player move grid around

To Plan:
- Switching turns change between local players?
- Moving row interaction
- Turn Display/indicator
- Environment/Background
- Music
- AI?

Stretch:
- Mouse Characters
- Jump/walk animations
- Timeline visuals for blocks moving
- Idle/fidget animations

Fun Ides to expand on:
- Mice/player can have abilities/power ups (like worms) such as
	- borrow through a cheese block
	- Jump up a cheese block
	- Teleport through
	- Swap places with another mice? Might be counter intuitive
	- Move a collumn more than 1 slot
	- Move more than one collumn
	- Skip a players turn
- Larger/smaller maps
-
