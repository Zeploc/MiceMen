UI
- Base in code, bind widgets

Visual/Gameplay
- Highlight collumns on players turn
- Yellow for moveable, red for collumn which can't be moved
- Green when held
- Arrows on top and bottom show when hover
- Arrows change when snapping to new position (hide/ only show other direction)

UI/Game loop
- Difficulty - easy/hard
- AI vs local player
- Grid Size (default, custom sliders)
- Sandbox mode, single player move grid around

To Plan:
- Switching turns change between local players?
- Moving row interaction
- Turn Display/indicator
- Environment/Background
- Music
- AI?

Stretch:
- Mouse Characters
- Jump/walk animations
- Timeline visuals for blocks moving
- Idle/fidget animations

Fun Ides to expand on:
- Mice/player can have abilities/power ups (like worms) such as
	- borrow through a cheese block
	- Jump up a cheese block
	- Teleport through
	- Swap places with another mice? Might be counter intuitive
	- Move a collumn more than 1 slot
	- Move more than one collumn
	- Skip a players turn
- Larger/smaller maps
-
