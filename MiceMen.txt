Todo Formatting:
- Comments above ifs explaining what they are checking
- Functions returning bool that are confusing bool return
- Commenting clear
Functions
-Does it tell me what it actually does
-Does it do just that, or is there other things it is doing as well
Move static functions to helper utils?
Go through todo comments

Todo:
- AI Advanced turn column instantly moves instead of lerp
- Performance
- Add test to see if all mice that completed were correctly scored
- Ratio blocks so there are enough empty ones?
- Event log for debugging - Log Macro, Add location (place in code called) in macro + object

- Turns completed in [number]
- UI control starting mice in gameplay
- UI control grid size in game
- Set gameplay modes info in singleton, with display name and description

Visual/Gameplay
- Need visuals for columns that can't be moved, ie same column moved or 6 times in a row
- Mouse move faster but leave trail
- Arrows on top and bottom show when hover
- Arrows change when snapping to new position (hide/ only show other direction)
- When dragging visualise element that wraps around
- Bounce visual jumping on another mouses head
- Improve snapping

To put in readme:
- Controls (+ debug grid - Not in shipping)
- Logging system
- Debug methods
- Controller/local player setup
- Further decisions for if networked
- Pragma Region explanation (collapse/expand)
- Unique situations found and solved (stalemate, non falling mouse, blocked columns)
- Things not addressed
- AI advanced could account for when no direct good moves occur
- AI advanced could account for other players to not move them, or to block them
- Possibly testing situations
- Things I would have done further
- Future Plans

Gamemode
- Handles turns
- Setup grid Manager

Grid Manager
- Creates grid Elements
- Grid Rebuild
- Grid interaction with gameplay elements

Grid object
- Grid - Array<GridInfo> Collumns by rows (x by y)
- Handles & Updates Grid
- Store free slots as map, updated on change (reduce iteration)
- Grid Cleanup


Gameplay Elements
- Cheese/Block Actor
- Mouse Actor - Not a pawn/character

Pawn
- Gameplay Interaction
- View

Player Controller
- UI control
- Local player per side
- Begin Turn function

UI
- Base in code, bind widgets


UI/Game loop
- Difficulty - easy/hard
- AI vs local player
- Grid Size (default, custom sliders)
- Sandbox mode, single player move grid around

To Plan:
- Environment/Background
- AI?

Stretch:
- Mouse Characters
- Jump/walk animations
- Timeline visuals for blocks moving
- Idle/fidget animations

Fun Ides to expand on:
- Mice/player can have abilities/power ups (like worms) such as
	- borrow through a cheese block
	- Jump up a cheese block
	- Teleport through
	- Swap places with another mice? Might be counter intuitive
	- Move a collumn more than 1 slot
	- Move more than one collumn
	- Skip a players turn
- Larger/smaller maps
-
